My Coding Journey: Exploring C Programming and Beyond
Welcome to my coding journey repository! Here, I document my progress and learning adventures in the realm of programming, with a special focus on mastering the C programming language. As an enthusiast with a solid understanding of languages like Python and JavaScript, I embark on this journey to deepen my understanding of computer science fundamentals and hone my skills in low-level programming.

Introduction
Programming has always been my passion, serving as both a creative outlet and a problem-solving tool. Over the years, I've explored various programming languages, each offering its unique set of features and challenges. From the high-level simplicity of Python to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, I've delved into different paradigms and ecosystems, continually expanding my knowledge and skill set.

Despite my proficiency in these languages, I've long been intrigued by the elegance and efficiency of C programming. Often hailed as the "mother of all languages," C lies at the heart of modern computing, powering everything from operating systems to embedded systems. Its simplicity, coupled with its powerful capabilities, makes it a cornerstone of software development, and mastering it opens doors to a deeper understanding of computer science principles.

Goals and Objectives
With this repository, I aim to document my journey as I dive into the world of C programming. My primary objectives include:

Mastering the Fundamentals: I strive to gain a solid understanding of the core concepts of C programming, including syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and pointers. By grasping these fundamentals, I lay a strong foundation for tackling more advanced topics and challenges.

Exploring Data Structures and Algorithms: In addition to learning the language itself, I'm committed to sharpening my skills in data structures and algorithms (DSA) through hands-on practice and problem-solving. I'll be tackling a variety of DSA problems and providing detailed solutions to reinforce my understanding and enhance my problem-solving abilities.

Applying C in Real-World Projects: Beyond theoretical knowledge, I aim to apply my C programming skills in real-world projects, ranging from small utilities to larger-scale applications. By actively coding and building projects, I not only solidify my understanding of the language but also develop practical experience that translates into proficiency.

Repository Structure
1. src Directory
This directory contains the source code files for my C programming exercises, projects, and solutions to DSA problems. Organized into subdirectories based on topic or project, each file is carefully annotated and documented to aid comprehension and serve as a reference for future learning.

2. problems Directory
Here, you'll find a collection of DSA problems that I've tackled using C programming. Each problem is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the problem statement, my approach to solving it, and the corresponding code implementation. Through these exercises, I aim to reinforce key concepts and enhance my problem-solving skills.

3. projects Directory
In this directory, I showcase my C programming prowess through various projects, ranging from simple utilities to more complex applications. From command-line tools to graphical user interfaces, each project demonstrates my ability to apply C in practical scenarios and showcases my creativity and ingenuity as a programmer.

How to Use This Repository
